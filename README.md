Femtasy-Starwars is a React app fetching data from the SWAPI API to display the Star Wars films and their characters. The app was designed with a *mobile first* approach.

For each film, discover the director's name, an associated film poster, and the film's characters.

Learn more about each character by clicking on their name. 

Films and characters can be added to a list of favorites and reviewed individually.
